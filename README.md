# dine_and_dash
Application to streamline the movie &amp; dinner experience

This was the fourth project completed for the General Assembly
Full time Immersive course week long project sprint.
It is aimed to answer the chaotic and fragmented User experience just
to plan something as simple as dinner and a movie. The application
is build on Ruby on Rails with AngularJS as the front-end platform and
persisted by a PostgreSQL database. It also utilizes the Yelp API and
Gracenote Connect API.

Any additional planning information and mocks are available within the
planning folder.
